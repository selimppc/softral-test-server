Hi , I am Dhaval Jani, A Professional PHP developer. I can make efficient website in any PHP framework you want to create on. As you know, there are CMS frameworks Like Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, Magento Etc. I have worked on jQuery , Ajax and Javascript that validate the pages and make the web good looking. There are MVC frameworks as well that are best suitable to add security and provide lots of features in a website. I have created lots of sites in different PHP frameworks. The most difficult one for me was A Blog Social website created in Yii2.0 Framework. 

My strength is I can't quit until the job is done, I keep solving the bug until its solved without seeking the help from others as I know I am capable of doing everything.

I created a E - Commerce website in Wordpress using Woocommerce. It was very big test for me to built a checkout page in this framework. Visit the project link for more info.
